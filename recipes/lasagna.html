    <p>
        Lasagne are a type of wide, flat pasta, possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. Lasagne, or the singular lasagna, is also an Italian dish made of stacked layers of this flat pasta alternating with fillings such as rag√π and other vegetables, cheese, and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with melted grated mozzarella cheese. Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting lasagne casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.

    </p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt generously, and boil the noodles until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Drain and pat dry. Oil a baking sheet or tray, and lay out the noodles flat, not touching each other, so they do not stick together.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion until softened and lightly colored, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Add the ground beef, and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, and simmer for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of the noodles. Spread a thin layer of the bechamel over the noodles. Sprinkle with a little less than 1/4 cup of the Parmesan and about 1/3 cup of the mozzarella. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of noodles topped with bechamel sauce and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake until the lasagna is heated through and the top is browned and bubbly, about 45 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with basil.</li>
